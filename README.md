This project is inspired by a project in a class where I predicted the selling prices of houses in King County (Seattle area) utilizing linear regression. Since I live in the Johnson County (Kansas) area, I decided it would be interesting to do a similar thing, but also exploring with more complex models such as Decision Trees and Random Forest models.
